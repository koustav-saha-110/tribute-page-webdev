            <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>
            <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, fondly known as the "Missile Man of India," was a distinguished scientist, visionary leader, and the 11th President of India. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam emerged from humble beginnings to become one of the most revered figures in Indian history.Kalam's journey epitomizes the triumph of determination, perseverance, and intellect. Raised in a modest household, he faced financial constraints but remained undeterred in pursuing his education. His passion for aeronautics led him to graduate in physics from St. Joseph's College, Trichy, and later in aerospace engineering from Madras Institute of Technology.His illustrious career at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) showcased his brilliance in missile technology. He played a pivotal role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, establishing India as a nuclear power. However, it wasn't merely his scientific acumen that set Kalam apart; it was his unwavering commitment to using science and technology for societal progress. He believed in harnessing innovation to address pressing issues like poverty, healthcare, and education.</p>
